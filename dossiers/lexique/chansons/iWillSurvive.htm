<p align="center">Ce tube international r&eacute;sonne dans tous les club-houses 
  de rugby de France et de Navarre. Pour cause, elle a longtemps &eacute;t&eacute; 
  l&#146;hymne du Stade Fran&ccedil;ais avant d&#146;&ecirc;tre repris par les 
  champions du monde de football en 1998.</p>

  <font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">At first 
  I was afraid, I was petrified<br>
  Kept thinking I could never live without you by my side<br>
  But then I spent so many nights thinking how you did me wrong<br>
  And I grew strong<br>
  And I learned how to get along<br>
  And so you're back<br>
  From outer space<br>
  I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face<br>
  I should have changed that stupid lock, I should have made you leave your key<br>
  If I'd known for just one second you'd be back to bother me<br>
  Go on now, go, walk out the door<br>
  Just turn around now<br>
  'Cause you're not welcome anymore<br>
  Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye?<br>
  You think I'd crumble?<br>
  You think I'd lay down and die?<br>
  Oh no, not I, I will survive<br>
  Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive<br>
  I've got all my life to live<br>
  And I've got all my love to give and I'll survive<br>
  I will survive, hey, hey<br>
  It took all the strength I had not to fall apart<br>
  Kept trying hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart<br>
  And I spent oh-so many nights just feeling sorry for myself<br>
  I used to cry<br>
  But now I hold my head up high and you see me<br>
  Somebody new<br>
  I'm not that chained-up little person still in love with you<br>
  And so you felt like dropping in and just expect me to be free<br>
  Well, now I'm saving all my lovin' for someone who's loving me<br>
  Go on now, go, walk out the door<br>
  Just turn around now<br>
  'Cause you're not welcome anymore<br>
  Weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye?<br>
  You think I'd crumble?<br>
  You think I'd lay down and die?<br>
  Oh no, not I, I will survive<br>
  Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive<br>
  I've got all my life to live<br>
  And I've got all my love to give and I'll survive<br>
  I will survive<br>
  Oh<br>
  Go on now, go, walk out the door<br>
  Just turn around now<br>
  'Cause you're not welcome anymore<br>
  Weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye?<br>
  You think I'd crumble?<br>
  You think I'd lay down and die?<br>
  Oh no, not I, I will survive<br>
  Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive<br>
  I've got all my life to live<br>
  And I've got all my love to give and I'll survive<br>
  I will survive<br>
  I will survive </font> </p><br><br><br>
